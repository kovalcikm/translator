PoC for custom translator. 
Program expects file as paramater and prints translated output to console output.

Assumptions:
- 'Y' is consonant
- words not starting with vowel nor consonant are not changed
- whitespaces are not kept. Translated words in console output are delimited by space.
etc.

Translator is not final:
- tests are not complete
- some performance improvements are possible
- probably not all edge cases tested
